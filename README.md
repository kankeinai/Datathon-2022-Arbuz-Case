# Datathon 2022 Arbuz-Case

In this case, you are asked to solve a classic analytical task - customer churn prediction. Using provided labeled data, you have to determine which clients are most likely to lose interest and stop using your services - meaning the company should take action to save its client base.

The churn rate is a measure of the loss of customers over a certain period. The metric is especially important for online services, mobile applications, banks, telecom operators, and marketplaces.

How we consider a loss of a client in this case:

They had a certain minimum number of purchases over a given period to qualify as a regular client
They did not use our services for the next 60 days after the given period
We have already labeled the data according to the criteria above.

Here is a link to the presentation of the case

We wish you the best of luck in this challenge!
